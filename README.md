# Algorithms
## Artificial Intelligence
### Maze
* Depth First Search 
* Breadth First Search
* Greedy Best First Search
* A-star search

## Deep Learning
### Artificial Neural Network
* ANN (Fwd, Bwd)_Manual: <br>
  Consists of step by step working of Neural Networks performed on a randomly generated dataset, namely defining the layers, Forward and Backward Propogation and also updating the parameters during Back propogation

* ANN_Hidden_layers: <br>
  All steps namely defining the layers, Forward and Backward Propogation are performed on the MNIST dataset by creating functions for taking inputs and calculating cost automatically rather than hard coding for each layer. It also visualizes the Hidden layers giving a visualization of how the model learns.

## Machine Learning
